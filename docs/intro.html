<p>You can label chapter and section titles using <code>{#label}</code> after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter <a href="intro.html#intro">2</a>. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter <a href="methods.html#methods">8</a>.</p>
<p>Figures and tables with captions will be placed in <code>figure</code> and <code>table</code> environments, respectively.</p>
<p><strong><em>What is R?</em></strong> *</p>
<p>R is a free language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. You can perform a variety of tasks using R language. Some are as follows -</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploring and Manipulating Data</li>
<li>Building and validating predictive models</li>
<li>Applying machine learning and text mining algorithms</li>
<li>Creating visual appealing graphs</li>
<li>Connecting with Databases</li>
<li>Building online dynamic reports or dashboards</li>
<li>Send emails or push notification via R</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>What is RStudio and its benefits over standard R?</em></strong></p>
<p>RStudio was built to make your life easy as a R programmer. It is available in open source for FREE. Unlike standard R, it supports various premium features such as intelligent code completion, syntax highlighting, structured R documentation, interactive debugging tool etc.</p>
<p><strong><em>Some Useful RStudio Shortcuts</em></strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Press CTRL + Enter to submit code</li>
<li>Press CTRL + SHIFT + C to comment/ uncomment code</li>
<li>Press CTRL + SHIFT + N to create a new R script</li>
</ol>
<p>###Basics of R Programming###</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Write your first equation in R Enter 5*3 in the RStudio code editor window and hit CTRL + ENTER in RStudio (or press F5 in standard R)</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>## [1] 15</code></pre>
<p>The [1] tells you the resulting value is the first result</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The ‘#’ at the beginning of a line signifies a ‘comment’ Try Shift+Cntrl+c on Rstudio NOTE : ‘###’ has different meaning in R-Markdown syntax</p></li>
<li><p>The operator ‘&lt;-’ is equivalent to ‘=’ sign, you can use either of the operators. NOTE: ‘&lt;-’ is preferred to ‘=’ in R as assignment operator</p></li>
<li><p>setwd() function assigns a working directory ‘setwd()’ is similar to ‘Libname’ in SAS envirnoment</p></li>
<li><p>getwd() function shows working directory</p></li>
<li><p>R uses ‘NA’</p></li>
