You can use anything that Pandocs Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot; &quot;clinicalfd&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. "],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. What is R? * R is a free language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. You can perform a variety of tasks using R language. Some are as follows - Exploring and Manipulating Data Building and validating predictive models Applying machine learning and text mining algorithms Creating visual appealing graphs Connecting with Databases Building online dynamic reports or dashboards Send emails or push notification via R What is RStudio and its benefits over standard R? RStudio was built to make your life easy as a R programmer. It is available in open source for FREE. Unlike standard R, it supports various premium features such as intelligent code completion, syntax highlighting, structured R documentation, interactive debugging tool etc. Some Useful RStudio Shortcuts Press CTRL + Enter to submit code Press CTRL + SHIFT + C to comment/ uncomment code Press CTRL + SHIFT + N to create a new R script ###Basics of R Programming### Write your first equation in R Enter 5*3 in the RStudio code editor window and hit CTRL + ENTER in RStudio (or press F5 in standard R) # Write your first equation in R 5 * 3 ## [1] 15 The [1] tells you the resulting value is the first result The # at the beginning of a line signifies a comment Try Shift+Cntrl+c on Rstudio NOTE : ### has different meaning in R-Markdown syntax The operator &lt;- is equivalent to = sign, you can use either of the operators. NOTE: &lt;- is preferred to = in R as assignment operator setwd() function assigns a working directory setwd() is similar to Libname in SAS envirnoment getwd() function shows working directory R uses NA getwd() Study CDISCPilot01 Guide to Analysis Data Note on Input Data Sources The analysis files for this study were derived from the submitted SDTM files. SDTM files were prepared from CRF data according to version 3.1.2 of the SDTM IG (with amendment 1). No non-CRF or non-SDTM data were used to create the ADaM data. The datasets include only subjects who were enrolled in the study. Subjects who failed screening criteria were not included in analysis datasets. Where to Find Key Data Demographics and Populations The ADSL (Subject Level Analysis Data) dataset contains all subject-level variables for demographics, subject characteristics, and population flags. Safety Key safety data are found in the datasets ADAE (Adverse Events Analysis Data), ADLBC (Laboratory Results Chemistry Analysis Data), ADLBH (Laboratory Results Hematology Analysis Data), ADLBHY (Laboratory Results Hys Rule Analysis Data), ADVS (Vital Signs Analysis Dataset). ADTTE is specifically for safety analyses of the time to the first dermatologic AE. Dermatologic AEs are considered an adverse event of special interest. Efficacy Study CDISCPilot01 has two primary endpoints, the Alzheimers Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale, total of 11 items [ADAS-Cog (11)] at Week 24 and the Video-referenced Clinicians Interview-based Impression of Change (CIBIC+) at Week 24. All ADAS-Cog data, including the first primary endpoint, can be found in the dataset ADQSADAS. All CIBIC+ data, including the second primary endpoint, can be found in the dataset ADQSCIBC. Mean Revised Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-X) data are considered secondary. These data can be found in the dataset ADQSNPIX. Protocol Deviations Protocol deviations were not reported in the source database and have not been incorporated into the SDTM data. As a result, such data do not exist among the analysis data. Core Variables The following core variables were merged from ADSL into all analysis datasets: STUDYID, SITEID, USUBJID, TRTSDT, TRTEDT, AGE, AGEGR1, AGEGR1N, SEX, RACE, and RACEN. The table below summarizes the treatment variables and population flags that exist among different groups of analysis requirements: Dataset(s) Treatment Variables Population Flags ADSL TRT01P, TRT01PN, TRT01A,TRT01AN SAFFL, DSRAEFL,ITTFL, EFFFL,COMP24FL ADAE TRTA, TRTAN SAFFL ADLBH,ADLBC, ADLBHY TRTP, TRTPN, TRTA,TRTAN SAFFL,COMP24FL,DSRAEFL ADVS TRTP, TRTPN, TRTA,TRTAN SAFFL ADTTE TRTP, TRTA, TRTAN SAFFL ADQSADAS, ADQSNPIX, ADQSCIBC TRTP, TRTPN ITTFL, EFFFL,COMP24FL Treatment variable values are based on the numeric dose level (i.e., 0, 54, 81) to avoid the need for a separate variable that contains the treatment dose. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure!

For full details of all analysis data sets, including key analysis results 3.1 ADAE  Adverse Events Analysis Data ADAE contains one record per reported event per subject. Subjects who did not report any Adverse Events are not represented in this dataset. The data reference for ADAE is the SDTM AE (Adverse Events) domain and there is a 1-1 correspondence between records in the source and this analysis dataset. These records can be linked uniquely by STUDYID, USUBJID, and AESEQ. As with the SDTM AE data set, all MedDRA code variables (i.e. those variables that end in CD) have missing values and dummy terms have been applied to the MedDRA High Level Term (HLT) and High Level Group Term (HLGT). This is due to the proprietary nature of the MedDRA dictionary and the fact that the data with this project will be made available to the public. In a standard submission, these codes and terms should be non-missing and properly populated. Events of particular interest (dermatologic) are captured in the customized query variable (CQ01NAM) in this dataset.Since ADAE is a source for ADTTE, the first chronological occurrence based on the start dates (and sequence numbers) of the treatment emergent dermatological events are flagged (AOCC01FL) to facilitate traceability between these two analysis datasets. ADAE also contains additional Occurrence Flags to facilitate traceability, reviewability, and easy of reporting between the analysis dataset and the unique counts in the summary tables. For treatment emergent adverse events refer to define.xml documentation for the following variables: AOCCFL, AOCCSFL, and AOCCPFL for summarization at the subject,System Organ Class, and Preferred Term levels, respectively. Similarly, refer to the define.xml documentation for AOCC02FL, AOCC03FL, and AOCC04FL for summarization of serious adverse events at the subject, System Organ Class, and Preferred Term levels. The three deaths reported during the conduct of this study are captured in the Results in Death Flag (AESDTH=Y) and Outcome of Adverse Event (AEOUT=FATAL). The Start Date of the Adverse Event in ADAE is imputed to the first of the month if the day is missing. The Study Day of Event Start (ASTDY) and the Treatment Emergent Analysis Flag (TRTEMFL) are derived based on this imputation and may differ from their corresponding SDTM AE/SUPPAE variables Study Day of Start of Adverse Event (AESTDY) and Treatment Emergent Flag (AETRTEM). ADLBC&amp;BH  Laboratory Results Chemistry/Hematology Analysis Data** ADLBC and ADLBH contain one record per lab analysis parameter, per time point, per subject.** ADLBC contains lab chemistry parameters and ADLBH contains hematology parameters and these data are derived from the SDTM LB (Laboratory Tests) domain. Two sets of lab parameters exist in ADLBC/ADLBH. One set contains the standardized lab value from the LB domain and the second set contains change from previous visit relative to normal range values. In some of the summaries the derived end-of-treatment visit (AVISITN=99) is also presented. 3.2 ADLBHY  Laboratory Results Hys Rule Analysis Data ADLBHY contains one record per lab test code per sample, per subject for the Hys Law based analysis parameters. ADLBHY is derived from the ADLBC (Laboratory Results Chemistry Analysis Data) analysis dataset. It contains derived parameters based on Hys law. 3.3 ADQSADAS  ADAS-COG Data ADQSADAS contains analysis data from the ADAS-Cog questionnaire, one of the primary efficacy endpoints. It contains one record per subject per parameter (ADAS-Cog questionnaire item) per VISIT. Visits are placed into analysis visits (represented by AVISIT and AVISITN) based on the date of the visit and the visit windows. If multiple visits fall into the same visit window, then the one closest to the target date is chosen for analysis. Records where ANL01FL=Y are the ones that were used for analysis. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) algorithm only considered records used for analysis as candidates to carry forward. Records where DTYPE=LOCF signify those where AVAL was imputed using the LOCF algorithm. Source data can be traced back to the SDTM.QS domain using USUBJID and QSSEQ.Details on how to derive the primary efficacy result based on ADAS-Cog data can be found in the analysis results metadata in the define.xml. 3.4 ADQSCIBC  CIBC Data ADQSCIBC contains analysis data from the from CIBIC+ questionnaire, one of the primary efficacy endpoints. It contains one record per subject per VISIT. Note that for all records, PARAM=CIBIC Score. Visits are placed into analysis visits (represented by AVISIT and AVISITN) based on the date of the visit and the visit windows. If multiple visits fall into the same visit window, then the one closest to the target date is chosen for analysis. Records where ANL01FL=Y are the ones that were used for analysis. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) algorithm only considered records used for analysis as candidates to carry forward. Records where DTYPE=LOCF signify those where AVAL was imputed using the LOCF algorithm. Source data can be traced back to the SDTM.QS domain using USUBJID and QSSEQ. Details on how to derive the primary efficacy result based on CIBIC+ data can be found in the analysis results metadata in the define.xml. 3.5 ADQSNPIX  NPI-X Item Analysis Data ADQSNPIX contains one record per subject per parameter (NPI-X questionnaire item, total score, and mean total score from Week 4 through Week 24) per analysis visit (AVISIT). The analysis visits (represented by AVISIT and AVISITN) are derived from days between assessment date and randomization date and based on the visit windows that were specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). If multiple assessments fall into the same visit window, then the one closest to the target day is chosen for analysis. Records where analysis flag (ANL01FL) = Y are the ones that were used for analysis. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) algorithm was not used for these data. Source data can be traced back to the SDTM.QS domain using USUBJID and QSSEQ. All the NPI-X parameters, except for the mean total score from Week 4 through Week 24 (NPTOTMN), are from SDTM.QS domain. The value of parameter, NPTOTMN, contains the mean total score for each patient who had any assessments from Week 4 through Week 24. The baseline value of the parameter, NPTOTMN, is the same as the baseline value of total score. The baseline value is a covariate in the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model.
